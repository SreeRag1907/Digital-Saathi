- Leverages the new Fabric architecture for improved performance
- Better suited for rural users familiar with native Android UI patterns

**Backend-as-a-Service**: Firebase (MVP Phase)
- Selected for superior offline synchronization capabilities
- Enables rapid MVP development and deployment
- Migration path to Supabase planned for cost optimization post-validation

**AI Integration**: Google Gemini API
- Gemini 1.5 Pro for multimodal crop diagnosis
- Gemini 2.5 Flash for text simplification and translation
- Structured prompt engineering for consistent, actionable responses

### 2. Core Implementation Features

#### Offline-First Architecture
- **Local Storage**: SQLite with AsyncStorage for caching
- **Sync Queue**: Background synchronization with conflict resolution
- **Data Caching**: Intelligent caching with expiration policies
- **Network Resilience**: Graceful degradation and recovery

#### AI-Powered Features
1. **Crop Diagnostics**: Multimodal image analysis with localized treatment recommendations
2. **Scheme Simplification**: Bureaucratic text converted to simple, actionable Hindi
3. **OCR Interpretation**: Product label scanning with agricultural context

#### Data Integration APIs
- **Weather**: IMD API (primary) + Google Weather API (fallback)

- Digital literacy videos
- Village news board
- Multi-language expansion

#### Phase 3: Conversational Interface (Year 2)
- Voice assistant integration
- Offline OCR scanner
- Partnership integrations
- Geographic expansion

### 5. Partnership Strategy

#### Distribution Channels
1. **Common Service Centres (CSCs)**: Primary distribution via 6.5L+ VLEs
2. **Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)**: Scientific credibility and validation
3. **NGO Partnerships**: Content integration and community adoption

#### Go-to-Market Approach
- B2B2C model leveraging trusted local networks
- Geographic focus: 2-3 districts initially
- Human-mediated technology adoption
- Community-based validation and feedback

### 6. Technical Implementation Details

#### Gemini API Integration
```typescript
// Crop Diagnosis Prompt Engineering
const cropDiagnosisPrompt = `
You are an expert agronomist specializing in Indian agriculture.
Analyze this ${cropType} crop image from ${location}.
Return structured JSON with:
- disease_name (Hindi)
- confidence_score (0-100)
- organic_treatments (available in India)
- chemical_treatments (Indian markets)
- prevention_tips (climate-specific)
`;
```

#### Offline Data Management
```typescript
// Sync Queue Implementation
interface SyncQueueItem {
  id: string;
  type: 'CREATE' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  collection: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
  status: 'PENDING' | 'SYNCING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'FAILED';
  retryCount: number;
}
```

### 7. Success Metrics

#### Technical KPIs
- App performance on low-end devices (target: <3s load time)
- Offline functionality uptime (target: 99%+)
- Data sync success rate (target: 95%+)
- AI response accuracy (target: 80%+ user satisfaction)

#### Business KPIs
- Daily Active Users (DAU) in target districts
- Feature adoption rates (especially AI features)
- User retention (7-day, 30-day)
- Partnership channel effectiveness

### 8. Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
- **API Reliability**: Multi-source data strategy with fallbacks
- **Device Compatibility**: Extensive testing on low-end Android devices
- **Network Constraints**: Aggressive caching and offline-first design

#### Market Risks
- **User Adoption**: Human-mediated onboarding via trusted channels
- **Content Accuracy**: Expert validation through KVK partnerships
- **Scalability**: Phased rollout with performance monitoring

### 9. Future Roadmap

#### Advanced Features (Year 3+)
- E-commerce integration for agri-inputs
- Hyperlocal job board
